## My process

In coding this layout I decided to practice SCSS and handlebars. I have began by concentrating on generating content from data.json file using handlebars.

Then I proceeded to design the site by tackling each section at a time and completing both mobile and desktop version before moving on to the next section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Handlebars templates
- Js fetch to display data from .json file
- Javascript for display of data and minor button actions



### What I learned

I have learned how to use SCSS in a project larger than a simple component. This knowledge will help me tremendously as SCSS brings a lot of advantages, especially in structuring the layout styles.


### Continued development

I want to expand my knowledge of BEM principles and continue using SCSS as I have found it extremely useful when working on layouts.
